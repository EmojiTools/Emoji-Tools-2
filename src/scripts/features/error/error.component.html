                    <p>Whatever you were doing just a moment ago broke Emoji Tools. It's okay though. It happens.
                        I'm
                        not mad! In fact, I'd like to know how you did it.</p>
                    <p>Please submit an issue on <a (click)="onClickSubmitIssue()">this page.</a> That way, I can
                        make
                        sure that it doesn't happen again.</p>
